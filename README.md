# Codebase of Master Thesis: Application-oriented Investigation of Domain Adaptation for 3D Object Detection in Automotive Point Clouds


## Installation for 3DTrans

You may refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for the installation of `3DTrans`.

## Getting Started

* Please refer to [Readme for Datasets](docs/GETTING_STARTED_DB.md) to prepare the dataset and convert the data into the 3DTrans format.

* Training and testing can be started with the train.sh and test.sh
* Zenseact dataset demo can be found in tools/zod_demo.py



## Visualization Tools for 3DTrans

- Our `3DTrans` supports the sequence-level visualization function [Quick Sequence Demo](docs/QUICK_SEQUENCE_DEMO.md) to continuously display the prediction results of ground truth of a selected scene.


## Acknowledge
* Our code is heavily based on [OpenPCDet v0.5.2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet). Thanks OpenPCDet Development Team for their awesome codebase.
